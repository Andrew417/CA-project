| ---: | :---: | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   T1 | WT/WB | Cold Read Miss (1)          | Verify first-time access handling     | Preload `RAM[0x0010]=DEAD_BEEF`; `READ 0x0010`     | Cache miss, data fetched from RAM, correct data returned, line filled |
|   T2 | WT/WB | Cold Read Miss (2)          | Reinforce compulsory miss behavior    | Same as T1 (first access path)                     | Confirms stable miss handling and RAM→cache path                      |
|   T3 | WT/WB | Read Hit                    | Verify hit detection after fill       | `READ 0x0010` again                                | Cache hit, low latency, correct data returned                         |
|   T4 |  WT   | Write Hit                   | Verify write-through on hit           | `WRITE 0x0010=CAFE_BABE`; read back; check RAM     | Cache and RAM updated immediately; read returns new value             |
|   T5 |  WT   | Write Miss                  | Verify write-allocate + write-through | `WRITE 0x0020=AAAA_5555`; read back; check RAM     | Line allocated, cache hit on read, RAM updated                        |
|   T6 | WT/WB | Different Sets              | Verify independent set operation      | Preload/read `0x0011`; then read `0x0010`          | Both cached independently; no conflict                                |
|   T7 | WT/WB | Set Fill (4 ways)           | Fill all ways in one set              | Read `0x0003,0x0043,0x0083,0x00C3`                 | All four ways store data; subsequent reads hit                        |
|   T8 | WT/WB | LRU Replacement             | Verify LRU eviction policy            | Touch ways 1–3; read new `0x0103`; reread `0x0003` | Least-recently-used line evicted; reaccess causes miss                |
|   T9 | WT/WB | RAW Hazard                  | Verify read-after-write correctness   | `WRITE 0x0100=9999_8888`; immediate read           | Read returns newly written data                                       |
|  T11 | WT/WB | Address Boundary            | Verify max address handling           | Preload/read `0xFFFF`                              | Correct data returned; no overflow issues                             |
|  WB1 |  WB   | Dirty Bit (No Immediate WB) | Verify deferred RAM update            | Read `0x0005`; write new value                     | RAM not updated immediately; dirty bit set                            |
|  WB2 |  WB   | Dirty Eviction              | Verify write-back on eviction         | Fill set; force eviction of dirty line             | Dirty data written back to RAM on eviction                            |
|  WB3 |  WB   | Write Miss Dirty            | Verify write-allocate in WB mode      | `WRITE 0x0200=A110_CA7E`                           | Cache line allocated dirty; RAM unchanged until eviction              |
|    — | WT/WB | Metrics                     | Track verification metrics            | All tests                                          | **Latency**, **correctness**, **automated pass/fail counting**        |
